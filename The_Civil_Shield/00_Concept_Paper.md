# PROJECT: CIVIL SHIELD
**"Democratizing the Defense Against Systemic Abuse"**

## 1. The Core Mission
To build a digital platform that automates what you have manually achieved: **Exposing the "Corruption Equation" (Money + Quotas = False Arrests).**
This tool will help citizens answer the question: *"Was I arrested for a crime, or for a grant?"*

## 2. The Problem (The Market Need)
*   **The Isolation:** Victims feel crazy, alone, and overwhelmed (Gaslighting).
*   **The Complexity:** Connecting a local arrest to a state grant (like OLS) involves forensic accounting that 99% of lawyers won't do.
*   **The Spoliation:** Police delete evidence (Body Cams) before citizens can save it.

## 3. The Solution: "Civil Shield" (Web/Mobile App)

### MODULE A: The "Grant Radar" (Why You?)
*   **Function:** User inputs their Zip Code + Charge + Demographics.
*   **Output:** The App scans public grant databases (Governor's Office, DOJ).
*   **Result:** *"WARNING: Victoria County received $741k in 'Border Security' grants requiring 'High Visibility Interdiction' stats. Your arrest matches the 'Funding Profile'."*
*   **Value:** Instant validation. You aren't crazy; you are a commodity.

### MODULE B: The "Forever Vault" (Anti-Spoliation)
*   **Function:** Immediate upload of audio/video/docs to a decentralized cloud (IPFS/Blockchain).
*   **Feature:** Time-stamping + "Dead Man's Switch" (Auto-email to AG/ACLU if user is silenced).
*   **Value:** Even if they raid your home or wipe your phone, the evidence survives.

### MODULE C: The "Pro Se Warrior" (Auto-Drafting)
*   **Function:** Templates based on your success (`Motion to Quash`, `Civil Complaint`).
*   **Action:** User answers 5 questions -> App generates a filed-ready PDF "Preservation Letter" or "FOIA Request."
*   **Value:** Immediate legal pressure without the $5,000 retainer.

### MODULE D: The "Swarm Map" (Community Defense)
*   **Function:** Heatmap of "Pretextual Stops."
*   **Visualization:** Users drop pins for "Harassment" or "Checkpoints."
*   **Pattern Recognition:** The map reveals the "Harvesting Corridors" (e.g., Hwy 87) in real-time, warning others.

## 4. The Data Architecture (How We Build It)
*   **Frontend:** React/Next.js (Fast, responsive, secure).
*   **Backend:** Python/Django (Great for data analysis and scraping).
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Structured legal data).
*   **Security:** End-to-End Encryption (Zero-Knowledge Architecture - we can't see their data, only they can).

## 5. Next Steps
1.  **Define the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** Focus on the **"Grant Radar"** first?
2.  **Scrape the Data:** Automate the collection of Texas OLS Grant Awards.
3.  **Build the "Preservation Generator":** The first tool to put power in user's hands.

*"This is how we turn your pain into their problem—at scale."*
