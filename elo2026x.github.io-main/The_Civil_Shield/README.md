# The Civil Shield
**Democratizing the Defense Against Systemic Abuse**

## Mission
To build a digital platform that automates the exposure of the "Corruption Equation" (Money + Quotas = False Arrests). This tool helps citizens answer the question: *"Was I arrested for a crime, or for a grant?"*

## Core Modules
1.  **The Grant Radar:** Correlates local arrests with State/Federal grant funding profiles.
2.  **The Forever Vault:** Decentralized, tamper-proof storage for evidence (Anti-Spoliation).
3.  **The Pro Se Warrior:** Auto-generates legal preservation letters and motions.
4.  **The Swarm Map:** Real-time visualization of "Harvesting Corridors."
