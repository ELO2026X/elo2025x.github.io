Formal Request for Strategic Audit: Victoria City/County Tax & Appraisal Operations
The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts
Formal Request for Comprehensive Audit of Victoria County Appraisal District, Victoria County Tax Office, and City of Victoria Financial Operations – Uncovering Systemic Abnormalities and Protecting American Taxpayers
Dear Acting Texas Comptroller Kelly Hancock and Esteemed Members of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts,
I am writing to formally request and demand a comprehensive and immediate audit into the operations, financial practices, and systemic processes of the Victoria County Appraisal District (VCAD), the Victoria County Tax Office, and the broader financial management of the City of Victoria, particularly as it relates to property and sales tax administration.
My exhaustive investigations and meticulous documentation of public financial records have uncovered numerous significant abnormalities and areas of concern that demand your immediate and decisive action. These findings, detailed below, reveal potential systemic issues, mismanagement, and a lack of transparency that directly impact American taxpayers.
Specifically, the intelligence I have gathered and analyzed highlights the following critical areas where your office can leverage this information for urgent inspection and audit efforts:
A. Property Valuation Anomalies (Victoria County Appraisal District - VCAD):
Inconsistent Valuations: Your office should investigate if similar properties are valued wildly differently without clear justification, as this could indicate favoritism or manipulation.
Unusual Exemptions/Reductions: Your office should scrutinize whether certain properties are receiving exemptions or significant value reductions that appear unwarranted or opaque.
Appraisal Methods: Your office should assess if VCAD's appraisal methods are consistent with state law and industry best practices.
Personnel Conflicts of Interest: Your office should determine if appraisers or board members have undisclosed financial interests in properties they are appraising or or companies that benefit from certain valuations.
Massive Increase in "ARB Under Protest" Values: Your office should investigate the dramatic increase in property values under protest from FY2025 ($255.6M) to FY2026 ($682.6M, as per "FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 8). This significant jump suggests potential issues with VCAD's initial appraisal accuracy or fairness that require immediate investigation.
B. Tax Collection & Disbursement Abnormalities (Victoria County Tax Office & City Tax Office):
Unusual Delinquencies/Waivers: Your office should investigate if there are patterns of certain individuals or entities consistently having large tax delinquencies waived or handled differently without clear legal basis.
Collection Rates: Your office should assess if collection rates are unusually low compared to similar counties, suggesting inefficiency or favoritism in enforcement.
Fee Structures: Your office should review whether fees charged for services (e.g., vehicle registration, property tax statements) are transparent and consistent with state guidelines.
Disbursement Irregularities: Your office should verify if collected tax revenues are being disbursed correctly and on time to all taxing entities.
Discrepancy in Tax Rate Worksheets: Your office must investigate the differing "Prior year M&O tax rate" figures found between "2024 RDB.110 Worksheet-SIGNED.pdf" and "2024 GVC TNT WRKSHT-SIGNED.pdf." This is a significant procedural and transparency concern that demands immediate clarification and could impact revenue calculations.
Justification for Tax Rate Above NNR: Your office should scrutinize the justification for setting the property tax rate above the No-New-Revenue (NNR) rate, leading to a 5.59% increase in property tax revenue ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 2; "2024 GVC.RB Notice about tax rate.pdf", Page 1). The audit should ensure the additional revenue is used efficiently and transparently.
High "Audit Collections" % Change in Sales Tax: Your office should investigate the extremely high 565.4% increase in "Audit Collections" for sales tax in May 2025 ("Monthly Report on Sales Tax Collections_202506130910335269.pdf", Page 2). This audit should determine the underlying causes and whether this indicates past underreporting or recent enforcement changes.
Negative "Other Collections" % Change in Sales Tax: Your office should investigate the significant negative change (-35.6%) in "Other Collections" for sales tax in May 2025 ("Monthly Report on Sales Tax Collections_202506130910335269.pdf", Page 2) to understand what types of collections decreased and why.
Sales Tax Budget vs. Actual Performance: Your office should assess if the budgeting process for sales tax revenue (both General Fund and VSTDC) is sufficiently rigorous and realistic, given consistent large positive variances between actuals and budget ("VSTDC Chart 05 2025_202506130911015801.pdf", Page 1; "City Chart 05 2025_202506130910481225.pdf", Page 1). Consistent under-budgeting can lead to less transparent allocation of "surplus" funds.
Property Tax Rate Decrease vs. Revenue Increase (City): Your office should investigate how the City's net property tax revenue increased despite a decrease in the tax rate, ensuring it's fully justified by growth in the tax base and not other factors ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 19, 51).
C. Operational Efficiency & Use of Resources (Victoria County & City of Victoria):
Budget vs. Performance: Your office should compare their budgets to their actual performance and services delivered.
Contracting Practices: Your office should investigate if contracts for services (e.g., software, security, maintenance) are awarded competitively and transparently. The audit should specifically look for sole-source contracts or contracts awarded to politically connected entities.
Staffing Levels & Payroll: Your office should assess whether staffing levels are justified by workload and if salaries, benefits, and overtime are consistent with comparable government positions.
Use of Equipment/Vehicles: Your office should determine if resources are being used efficiently and for legitimate purposes.
Elected Official Salary Increases: Your office should investigate the justification and transparency of salary increases for elected officials (e.g., County Judge, Commissioners, Sheriff, etc., as per "2025 Salary Notice Official.pdf", Page 1). The audit should determine if these are tied to performance or objective metrics, and if they are comparable to similar counties.
Sheriff and Juvenile Detention Budget Increases: Given serious allegations against the Victoria County Sheriff's Office (VCSO), your office should scrutinize the substantial budget increases for the Sheriff's Office ($303,781 increase in "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 11) and Juvenile Detention Facility ($463,471 increase in "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 12). The audit should investigate the justification, performance metrics, and allocation to ensure funds are not enabling or overlooking misconduct.
City Police and Fire Department Budget Increases: Similarly, your office should investigate the significant budget increases for the City of Victoria Police Department (9.39% increase) and Fire Department (17.83% increase) in FY2026 ("FY2025-26 Preliminary Budget_202506300944419125.pdf", Page 17, 34).
"Non-Departmental Expenses" (County): Your office should investigate large, broad categories like "Non-Departmental Expense" in the County budget ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Pages 35-36), especially the $175,000 for "Legal Services" and the $690,000 for "APPRAISAL DISTRICT." The audit should determine which firms are paid, what services are provided, and if these expenditures are truly in the public interest.
Forfeiture Funds (County): Your office should scrutinize the Sheriff's Forfeiture Fund ($899,025 balance) and CDA Contraband Forfeiture fund ($1,119,000 balance) in the County budget ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 9, 19-20) for transparency in source and use of funds.
Rural Salary Assistance Programs (County): Your office should verify that state-funded "Rural Sheriff's Office Salary Assistance Program" and "Rural Prosecutor's Office Salary Assistance Program" funds are applied correctly and that allowances like "GYM MEMBERSHIP" are appropriate uses of public funds ("2025 Salary Notice Official.pdf", Page 1; "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 9, 18).
City Overall Budget Increase: Your office should investigate the substantial overall budget increase for the City of Victoria from FY2025 ($194M) to FY2026 ($254M), a 30%+ increase in both expenses and revenues ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 5). The audit should determine the sustainability and justification for this rapid growth.
Use of Excess Fund Balance (City): Your office should scrutinize the use of excess fund balances for "one-time expenses" (e.g., $11.2M in FY26, "FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 6), ensuring these are justified, transparent, and provide clear public benefit.
Bond Proceeds & Debt (City): Your office should investigate the significant influx of bond proceeds ($33.3M in FY26) driving the City's revenue increase ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 7). The audit should ensure necessity, transparent allocation to projects, and efficient project management.
Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Increases (City): Your office should scrutinize the major increase in the City's CIP program ($38.5M increase to $78.98M in FY26), particularly the large allocation to the Community Center project ($28.94M) ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 14-15). The audit should ensure project scope, costs, funding, and management are transparent and efficient. Also, your office should investigate the dramatic increase in the FY2024 CIP budget (111.68% overall increase, with CIP 3037 up 248.96%) ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 21).
Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) Allocations: Your office should scrutinize the allocations of Hotel Occupancy Tax funds to various beneficiaries (e.g., Convention or information centers: 47.43%, "Sb1221-online-template - Year Ending 9-30-22_202302131729585017_202312181423556549_202503141345212359.pdf", Page 1). The audit should ensure these comply with specific legal definitions of eligible HOT expenditures and are not for general operational costs. Also, your office should assess the realism of HOT revenue projections given past budget variances ("Motel Tax History - Tied to CAFR FY 2024-2025 March 2025.pdf", Page 1).
Over-Expenditures in General Fund Departments (City): Your office should investigate consistent or significant overspending in General Fund departments (e.g., City Manager, Non-departmental, Fire) as noted in the FY2023 ACFR ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 63, Note 2), and assess the effectiveness of internal controls for budgetary compliance.
Deficit Fund Equity (City): Your office should investigate the deficit fund equity balance in the CDBG Hazard Mitigation Fund ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 63, Note 2), ensuring it was temporary and resolved, and identify any systemic issues that led to it.
Police Overtime vs. Vacancies (City): Your office should investigate if high police department vacancy rates are contributing to excessive overtime, and what strategies are in place to address vacancies efficiently ("FY2025-26 Preliminary Budget_202506300944419125.pdf", Page 10).
Self-Finance/Stabilization Fund (City): Your office should scrutinize the discretionary use of the Self-Finance/Stabilization Fund for "one-time" expenditures to ensure transparency, proper authorization, and that funds are not used to circumvent regular budgeting processes ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 22).
Restatement of Prior Year Financial Statements (City): Your office should investigate the reasons for the restatement of FY2022 government-wide financial statements and fund financial statements ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 102, Note 22) to ensure they are due to genuine accounting corrections and not attempts to obscure financial performance or shift liabilities.
Sales Tax Revenue Budget Increase (City): Your office should assess if the sales tax revenue projections are realistic and if the "excess" revenues are being allocated transparently and efficiently, rather than being used for discretionary spending without prior public scrutiny ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 20, 51).
D. Transparency & Public Information Access:
PIR Compliance: Your office should investigate if Public Information Act requests are handled efficiently and transparently, or if there are patterns of delays, excessive fees, or unjustified redactions. This directly impacts public oversight.
Website/Public Data: Your office should assess if essential financial and operational data is readily available and easily understandable on their public websites.
Budget Calendar Execution: Your office should investigate whether the "as soon as possible" and "if needed" clauses in the County Budget Calendar are used to limit transparency or public engagement, and if tight timelines for public review genuinely allow for meaningful public input.
E. Investment Management (City):
Sales Tax Development Corporation (VSTDC) and Downtown TIRZ No.1 Audit Scope: Your office should specifically audit the financial statements of the VSTDC and Downtown TIRZ No.1, as they were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 28). This is a critical area for investigation to ensure their financial practices and compliance are up to standard.
Data Anomalies in Investment Reports: Your office must investigate why "Purchase Cost" and "Total Purchase" are listed as "$0" for some investments in the "Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf", Page 4). This could indicate data entry errors, accounting discrepancies, or unrecorded transactions.
Suboptimal Investment Yields: Your office should scrutinize why funds were invested in longer-term commercial paper at significantly lower yields (4.390%) than readily available short-term investment pools (around 5%) in Q4 2024 ("Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf", Page 4). The audit should assess if this aligns with the "prudent person" standard and maximizes returns.
Investment Policy Certification: Your office should verify that the City maintains current certifications for its investment policy and officers, as the provided certificate is for a past period (through March 31, 2024, "Investment policy certificate.jpg").
Investment Activity Volume: Your office should examine the rationale behind the high volume of investment purchases and maturities in the City's portfolio ("Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf", Page 3) to ensure optimal returns without excessive transaction costs.
Adherence to Investment Policy: Your office should verify that the City's investment practices, including the "Prudent Person" standard, align with its "Investment Policy - updated Jan 2022 - final v2_202210241546096607_202212131340266823.pdf" (Page 2, 7), and that annual reviews and independent auditor reviews are consistently performed.
IV. Expected Impact of an Audit by the Comptroller's Office
If your office undertakes a full audit of these entities and finds abnormalities:
Public Exposure: The findings would be made public, leading to significant media scrutiny and public pressure on the Tax Office and Appraisal District, and other audited entities.
Forced Reforms: They would be compelled to implement corrective actions to address any identified waste, fraud, inefficiency, or non-compliance.
Financial Recovery: If misuse of funds or fraud is found, efforts could be made to recover taxpayer money.
Increased Accountability: Individuals found responsible for misconduct could face disciplinary action, and potentially criminal charges if the findings are severe enough to warrant referral to appropriate law enforcement agencies.
By systematically targeting these entities with your office, I believe we can continue to expand the scope of transparency and accountability within Victoria County, ensuring that all aspects of local government are operating for the benefit of the American people.
Sincerely,
Emilio Hernandez Ortiz III
