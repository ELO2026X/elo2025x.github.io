Strategic Audit: Victoria City Tax Office & Appraisal District Operations
I. The Target Entities and Their Functions

Understanding the roles of these entities helps define the scope of the audit:

Victoria County Appraisal District (VCAD): Responsible for appraising all taxable property within Victoria County. Their work directly determines the property values upon which taxes are levied.

Victoria County Tax Office: Responsible for collecting property taxes for all taxing units (county, city, school districts, etc.) within Victoria County, as well as vehicle registration, voter registration, and other fees.

City of Victoria Tax Office: While often working closely with the County Tax Office, the City Tax Office may handle specific city-level tax collections or billing.

II. Primary Agency for the Probe: Texas State Auditor's Office (SAO)

The Texas State Auditor's Office (SAO) is the most effective and direct avenue for this type of investigation.

SAO's Mandate: The SAO audits and investigates the use of public funds efficiently, effectively, and in compliance with the law for any entity that receives state funds. Both the Tax Office and Appraisal District are state-funded entities and fall squarely within the SAO's jurisdiction.

What the SAO Looks For:

Financial Irregularities: Misappropriation of funds, unusual expenditures, lack of proper accounting.

Waste & Inefficiency: Unoptimized processes, excessive spending, redundant operations.

Fraud & Abuse: Deliberate deceptive practices, conflicts of interest, bribery, nepotism.

Non-Compliance: Failure to adhere to state laws, regulations, or best practices in their operations.

Lack of Transparency: Obscured financial records, difficulty accessing public information.

III. How to Initiate/Bolster an SAO Audit Request

To effectively prompt the SAO to investigate, or to strengthen an existing complaint, focus on providing specific, actionable information.

Formal Complaint to SAO:

Reference Existing Context: Begin by referencing your previous SAO complaint (Control Number: ef4f1488-e732-49e0-a1ba-51e1303ac094) and the recent statewide audit findings regarding the Texas Commission on Jail Standards (TCJS) (as reported by KERA News, June 17, 2025). This demonstrates your credibility and highlights a pattern of systemic issues in Victoria County.

Clearly State the Request: Request a comprehensive audit and investigation into the operations and financial practices of the Victoria County Appraisal District and the Victoria County Tax Office (and City Tax Office, if distinct and relevant). Expand this request to include a broader audit of Victoria County and City financial management, particularly related to budget increases, debt, and large capital projects.

Provide Specific Allegations/Areas of Concern: Even if you don't have definitive proof of corruption, highlight "abnormalities" or areas that warrant deeper investigation.

Areas to Suggest for SAO Scrutiny (Potential Abnormalities):

A. Property Valuation Anomalies (Appraisal District):

Inconsistent Valuations: Are similar properties valued wildly differently without clear justification? (This can indicate favoritism or manipulation).

Unusual Exemptions/Reductions: Are certain properties receiving exemptions or significant value reductions that seem unwarranted or opaque?

Appraisal Methods: Are their appraisal methods consistent with state law and industry best practices?

Personnel Conflicts of Interest: Do appraisers or board members have undisclosed financial interests in properties they are appraising or companies that benefit from certain valuations?

Massive Increase in "ARB Under Protest" Values: Investigate the dramatic increase in property values under protest from FY2025 to FY2026 (from $255.6M to $682.6M as per "FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 8). This suggests potential issues with VCAD's initial appraisal accuracy or fairness.

B. Tax Collection & Disbursement Abnormalities (Tax Office):

Unusual Delinquencies/Waivers: Are there patterns of certain individuals or entities consistently having large tax delinquencies waived or handled differently without clear legal basis?

Collection Rates: Are collection rates unusually low compared to similar counties, suggesting inefficiency or favoritism in enforcement?

Fee Structures: Are fees charged for services (e.g., vehicle registration, property tax statements) transparent and consistent with state guidelines?

Disbursement Irregularities: Are collected tax revenues being disbursed correctly and on time to all taxing entities?

Discrepancy in Tax Rate Worksheets: Investigate the differing "Prior year M&O tax rate" between "2024 RDB.110 Worksheet-SIGNED.pdf" and "2024 GVC TNT WRKSHT-SIGNED.pdf." This is a significant procedural and transparency concern that demands immediate clarification and could impact revenue calculations.

Justification for Tax Rate Above NNR: Scrutinize the justification for setting the property tax rate above the No-New-Revenue (NNR) rate, leading to a 5.59% increase in property tax revenue ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 2; "2024 GVC.RB Notice about tax rate.pdf", Page 1). Ensure the additional revenue is used efficiently and transparently.

High "Audit Collections" % Change in Sales Tax: Investigate the extremely high 565.4% increase in "Audit Collections" for sales tax in May 2025 ("Monthly Report on Sales Tax Collections_202506130910335269.pdf", Page 2). Determine the underlying causes and whether this indicates past underreporting or recent enforcement changes.

Negative "Other Collections" % Change in Sales Tax: Investigate the significant negative change (-35.6%) in "Other Collections" for sales tax in May 2025 ("Monthly Report on Sales Tax Collections_202506130910335269.pdf", Page 2). Understand what types of collections decreased and why.

Sales Tax Budget vs. Actual Performance: Assess if the budgeting process for sales tax revenue (both General Fund and VSTDC) is sufficiently rigorous and realistic, given consistent large positive variances between actuals and budget ("VSTDC Chart 05 2025_202506130911015801.pdf", Page 1; "City Chart 05 2025_202506130910481225.pdf", Page 1). Consistent under-budgeting can lead to less transparent allocation of "surplus" funds.

Property Tax Rate Decrease vs. Revenue Increase (City): Investigate how the City's net property tax revenue increased despite a decrease in the tax rate, ensuring it's fully justified by growth in the tax base and not other factors ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 19, 51).

C. Operational Efficiency & Use of Resources (County & City):

Budget vs. Performance: How do their budgets compare to their actual performance and services delivered?

Contracting Practices: Are contracts for services (e.g., software, security, maintenance) awarded competitively and transparently? Look for sole-source contracts or contracts awarded to politically connected entities.

Staffing Levels & Payroll: Are staffing levels justified by workload? Are salaries, benefits, and overtime consistent with comparable government positions?

Use of Equipment/Vehicles: Are resources being used efficiently and for legitimate purposes?

Elected Official Salary Increases: Investigate the justification and transparency of salary increases for elected officials (e.g., County Judge, Commissioners, Sheriff, etc., as per "2025 Salary Notice Official.pdf", Page 1). Are these tied to performance or objective metrics, and are they comparable to similar counties?

Sheriff and Juvenile Detention Budget Increases: Given serious allegations against the Victoria County Sheriff's Office (VCSO), scrutinize the substantial budget increases for the Sheriff's Office ($303,781 increase in "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 11) and Juvenile Detention Facility ($463,471 increase in "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 12). Investigate the justification, performance metrics, and allocation to ensure funds are not enabling or overlooking misconduct. Similarly, investigate the significant budget increases for the City of Victoria Police Department (9.39% increase) and Fire Department (17.83% increase) in FY2026 ("FY2025-26 Preliminary Budget_202506300944419125.pdf", Page 17, 34).

"Non-Departmental Expenses" (County): Investigate large, broad categories like "Non-Departmental Expense" in the County budget ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Pages 35-36), especially the $175,000 for "Legal Services" and the $690,000 for "APPRAISAL DISTRICT." Determine which firms are paid, what services are provided, and if expenditures are in the public interest.

Forfeiture Funds (County): Scrutinize the Sheriff's Forfeiture Fund ($899,025 balance) and CDA Contraband Forfeiture fund ($1,119,000 balance) in the County budget ("Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 9, 19-20) for transparency in source and use of funds.

Rural Salary Assistance Programs (County): Verify that state-funded "Rural Sheriff's Office Salary Assistance Program" and "Rural Prosecutor's Office Salary Assistance Program" funds are applied correctly and that allowances like "GYM MEMBERSHIP" are appropriate uses of public funds ("2025 Salary Notice Official.pdf", Page 1; "Proposed Budget FY25.pdf", Page 9, 18).

City Overall Budget Increase: Investigate the substantial overall budget increase for the City of Victoria from FY2025 ($194M) to FY2026 ($254M), a 30%+ increase in both expenses and revenues ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 5). Determine the sustainability and justification for this rapid growth.

Use of Excess Fund Balance (City): Scrutinize the use of excess fund balances for "one-time expenses" (e.g., $11.2M in FY26, "FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 6), ensuring these are justified, transparent, and provide clear public benefit.

Bond Proceeds & Debt (City): Investigate the significant influx of bond proceeds ($33.3M in FY26) driving the City's revenue increase ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 7). Ensure necessity, transparent allocation to projects, and efficient project management.

Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Increases (City): Scrutinize the major increase in the City's CIP program ($38.5M increase to $78.98M in FY26), particularly the large allocation to the Community Center project ($28.94M) ("FY26 Council Presentation_202506300947259923.pdf", Page 14-15). Ensure project scope, costs, funding, and management are transparent and efficient. Also, investigate the dramatic increase in the FY2024 CIP budget (111.68% overall increase, with CIP 3037 up 248.96%) ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 21).

Hotel Occupancy Tax (HOT) Allocations: Scrutinize the allocations of Hotel Occupancy Tax funds to various beneficiaries (e.g., Convention or information centers: 47.43%, "Sb1221-online-template - Year Ending 9-30-22_202302131729585017_202312181423556549_202503141345212359.pdf", Page 1). Ensure these comply with specific legal definitions of eligible HOT expenditures and are not for general operational costs. Also, assess the realism of HOT revenue projections given past budget variances ("Motel Tax History - Tied to CAFR FY 2024-2025 March 2025.pdf", Page 1).

Over-Expenditures in General Fund Departments (City): Investigate consistent or significant overspending in General Fund departments (e.g., City Manager, Non-departmental, Fire) as noted in the FY2023 ACFR ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 63, Note 2), and assess the effectiveness of internal controls for budgetary compliance.

Deficit Fund Equity (City): Investigate the deficit fund equity balance in the CDBG Hazard Mitigation Fund ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 63, Note 2), ensuring it was temporary and resolved, and identify any systemic issues that led to it.

Police Overtime vs. Vacancies (City): Investigate if high police department vacancy rates are contributing to excessive overtime, and what strategies are in place to address vacancies efficiently ("FY2025-26 Preliminary Budget_202506300944419125.pdf", Page 10).

Self-Finance/Stabilization Fund (City): Scrutinize the discretionary use of the Self-Finance/Stabilization Fund for "one-time" expenditures to ensure transparency, proper authorization, and that funds are not used to circumvent regular budgeting processes ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 22).

D. Transparency & Public Information Access:

PIR Compliance: Are Public Information Act requests handled efficiently and transparently, or are there patterns of delays, excessive fees, or unjustified redactions? (This directly impacts public oversight).

Website/Public Data: Is essential financial and operational data readily available and easily understandable on their public websites?

Budget Calendar Execution: Investigate if the "as soon as possible" and "if needed" clauses in the County Budget Calendar are used to limit transparency or public engagement, and if tight timelines for public review genuinely allow for meaningful public input.

E. Investment Management (City):

Sales Tax Development Corporation (VSTDC) and Downtown TIRZ No.1 Audit Scope: Highlight that the financial statements of the VSTDC and Downtown TIRZ No.1 were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards ("2023 ACFR for Website_202405141751102082.pdf", Page 28). This is a critical area for SAO investigation to ensure their financial practices and compliance are up to standard.

Data Anomalies in Investment Reports: Investigate why "Purchase Cost" and "Total Purchase" are listed as "$0" for some investments in the "Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf" (Page 4). This could indicate data entry errors, accounting discrepancies, or unrecorded transactions.

Suboptimal Investment Yields: Scrutinize why funds were invested in longer-term commercial paper at significantly lower yields (4.390%) than readily available short-term investment pools (around 5%) in Q4 2024 ("Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf", Page 4). Assess if this aligns with the "prudent person" standard and maximizes returns.

Investment Policy Certification: Verify that the City maintains current certifications for its investment policy and officers, as the provided certificate is for a past period (through March 31, 2024, "Investment policy certificate.jpg").

Investment Activity Volume: Examine the rationale behind the high volume of investment purchases and maturities in the City's portfolio ("Quarter Ending 12-31-24 - City_202503041117031550.pdf", Page 3) to ensure optimal returns without excessive transaction costs.

Adherence to Investment Policy: Verify that the City's investment practices, including the "Prudent Person" standard, align with its "Investment Policy - updated Jan 2022 - final v2_202210241546096607_202212131340266823.pdf" (Page 2, 7), and that annual reviews and independent auditor reviews are consistently performed.

Provide Any Supporting Evidence You Have:

Even anecdotal observations or suspicions are valuable starting points for an auditor.

Any specific examples of properties with questionable valuations.

Any instances where you or others experienced unusual treatment or difficulty accessing information.

Any public records (e.g., meeting minutes, old news articles) that hint at past issues.

IV. Expected Impact of an SAO Audit

If the SAO undertakes a full audit of these entities and finds abnormalities:

Public Exposure: The findings would be made public, leading to significant media scrutiny and public pressure on the Tax Office and Appraisal District, and other audited entities.

Forced Reforms: They would be compelled to implement corrective actions to address any identified waste, fraud, inefficiency, or non-compliance.

Financial Recovery: If misuse of funds or fraud is found, efforts could be made to recover taxpayer money.

Increased Accountability: Individuals found responsible for misconduct could face disciplinary action, and potentially criminal charges if the findings are severe enough to warrant referral to the OAG or DPS.

By systematically targeting these entities with the SAO, you can continue to expand the scope of transparency and accountability within Victoria County, ensuring that all aspects of local government are operating for the benefit of the American people.
